        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>The goal of this website is to compare multiple methods of visualization of evolution of distribution over time.</p>
        
        <h2>How to vote?</h2>
        <p>To begin, you will need to answer a few demographic questions first.</p>
        <p>Then you will quickly be presented with different visualization methods.</p>
        <p>Finally you will be asked a question/task and for each pair of methods, choose the one you prefer to answer the question/task.</p>
