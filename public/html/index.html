        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>The goal of this website is to compare multiple methods of visualization of evolution of distribution over time.</p>
        
        <h2>How to vote?</h2>
        <p>To begin, you will need to answer a few demographic questions.</p>
        <p>Then you will quickly be presented with different visualization methods.</p>
        <p>Finally you will be asked to compare different visualization methods on a task. For each pair of methods, you will choose the one you prefer to complete the task or if they are similar.</p>
